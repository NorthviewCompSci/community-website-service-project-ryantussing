                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>The Northview Boys Soccer program is a competitive high school sports program. The team competes 
                        in the Northern Lakes League, along with Anthony Wayne, Bowling Green, Maumee, Perrysburg,
                        Springfield, Southview, and Napoleon. They are a Division I program and compete as such
                        throughout the year and in the postseason playoffs.

                        In the last three years, the Wildcats have been a very successful program. They have won 
                        two district championships (beating rivals Southview in '17 and Anthony Wayne in '18), 
                        advanced to the regional finals twice (losing to Medina in '17 and St. Ignatius in '18), 
                        finished once as district runners up (losing to Anthony Wayne in '19), and won one 
                        NLL title (in '18).
